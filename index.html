                    <h3> Game Developer &amp; Computer Science Student</h3>
                    <p class="about-me-paragraph">
                      Hello! When I am not studying or tutoring Computer Science at Concordia University Irvine I like to spend my time working on personal software projects.
                      I have a huge passion for not only developing video games but programming pretty much anything in general! Unity Engine, Visual Studio, and C# are my go-to tools for working on projects,
                      although I love working with many others such as C++, Java, and Eclipse. Part of the reason why I enjoy programming and game development so much has to do with my love for problem-solving itself;
                      I’ve always gravitated towards hobbies that require critical thinking. Whether it’s been strategy-oriented games or having to analyze the patterns of an opposing football team.
                      Whatever challenge or game I come across in life, growth is always my focus!

                    <p>
                        This 3D Roguelike designed specifically for mobile phones is a project I’ve been constantly working on for about 4 months.
                        It incorporates many new programming practices such as Data-Oriented programming using Unity Engine’s new “Data Oriented Technical Stack” also known as DOTS.
                        The project has been built solely by me using Unity Engine, Visual Studio, and primarily the C# language.
                        My three favorite functions I’ve programmed would be the joystick movement/combat system, the individual AI agents, and the automatic targeting system.
                        However what I’m most proud of so far is the code organization and optimization throughout the project,
                        as it currently contains 40+ individual script files, many of which inherit and implement one another.
                        This project exemplifies some of my best work! (See Video)

                    <p>
                        Star Comet is a mobile game I released during my sophomore year of high school. Being my first ever release, this simple vertical scrolling game is one that I take a lot of pride in.
                        Star Comet is where my love for game development exponentially grew, as I learned and executed the entire process incorporated in making video games, whether it was code, art, or publishing.
                        This project not only increased my programming and other game-oriented skills, but it also taught me a great deal of patience and perseverance.
                        Without those two character traits, the completion of this project or any future ones would have never been possible. (See Video)

                  <p>
                      Entropic Space is a recent five-day project built for a Game Jam. The theme of the Jam was "Lost in Space." I took it pretty literally, creating a minimalistic 3D space shooter.
                      While it is a simple game, there were specific mechanics I found challenging to implement, especially within the five-day time frame I had. Most notably, the Flight System and Enemy Ship AI posed some obstacles.
                      Luckily I had a team of friends to help me out: one with development, one with 3D modeling, and finally one with composing sounds and music.
                      I lead them through the process, and due to their help, I was able to focus my attention on the more complicated obstacles. Thanks to them, I was able to complete this project within the given time-frame.

                    <p>
                        Soul Snatcher is a WebGL game built within 48 hours for a Game Jam. The theme required in the competition was "Death is Good."
                        To go by the theme, the player does not lose when they die. Instead, they power up, attacking more quickly.
                        The catch is every time the player shoots; they lose some of their "soul" life. Run out of life, and it's game over!
                        The player can't die too many times, or else they won't be able to handle the power given to them.
